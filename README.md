## About The Project <br>

This is a project for the course SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence).

## Problem Definition <br>
> Filtering, prioritizing, and effectively delivering important information on streaming platforms, where the quantity of options is overwhelming, is necessary to alleviate the problem of information overload, which has become a potential concern for many users.

## Models Used
1. Natural Language Processing
2. Multiple Linear Regression

## Conclusions

1. We found the movies recommended by our model to be similar to the one inputted. This means similar movies have keywords in common. 


2. We also found out that a lot of descriptions had rooted or synonyms keywords and hence cleaning the data made our model more effective.


3. Against popular belief, budget, revenue or popularity of a movie doesnâ€™t have a high correlation with its ratings.
4. Though higher budget generally tends to generate more revenue and popularity.
